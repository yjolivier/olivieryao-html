# Story Show Gallery - minimalist, vertical photo gallery, mobile friendly

Show a story with your photos in fullscreen lightbox without distracting elements. Story Show Gallery is verticall and a site visitor just need to scroll (or touch) to view image by image with optimally placed captions. The goal of Story Show Gallery is making the best possible experience when viewing photos.

SSG is also in the form of a [Wordpress plugin](https://ssg.flor.cz/wordpress/).

## Main features

- Story Show Gallery is fully **responsive** - works on a desktop, tablets and smartphones. SSG compares image size vs. screen size and place a caption to an optimal position:

- **Fullscreen** mode with an unobtrusive scrollbar and cursor. Even dark photos are well visible. On smartphones, full screen mode works **like on YouTube**, it activates after rotating a phone into landscape mode

- Story Show Gallery supports **Google analytics**. When a user views an image it is counted as a virtual pageview.

- There are **3 ways** how a photo gallery can be created. Automatically from images on the page, by passing an array of images into SSG, or by combination of both.

- **No e√óit mode:** You can write just a minimal HTML code and SSG creates a gallery which works like a separate webpage. Because there is not much to display without SSG, the gallery can run in the no exit mode. See a [minimal crash course](https://ssg.flor.cz/minimal-crash-course/) how to use SSG.

- Story Show Gallery can display **watermark - logo** over images.

- **Jump scroll** automatically scrolls from image to image. Images are being gradually **lazy loaded** as a user scrolls down.

- Every image has its own address, so you can **link into the gallery** to show a [particular photo](https://ssg.flor.cz/#element).

- Story Show Gallery can load a **signpost** to other galleries behind the last photo. [See the sample](https://ssg.flor.cz/signpost/).

- Animated transition between images combines sliding and fading. The visual effect is similar to old slide projectors.

- Protection of photos from being copied via right click menu.
